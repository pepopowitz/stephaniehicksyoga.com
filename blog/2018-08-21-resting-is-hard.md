  Triathletes can sometimes have Type A personalities when it comes to workouts,
  and I wholeheartedly admit that I am one of these athletes. Lauren Fleshman
  once said that training plan box-checking is not an Olympic sport, but if it
  was, I'd surely have some Olympic bling by now. It is most important for box
  checkers like me to incorporate rest and recovery into their race plan. Read
  on to find out why this is an important, but at times difficult, aspect of
  training and racing.

A week has gone by since the awesomeness of IronGirl. It is great to bask in the glow of a great race, but eventually I get back into the routine of life. The day after a race, the kids just want oatmeal, I have to go to work, the Instagram and Facebook likes cease, and life simply goes on. By the middle of the week, I have to stop and pause for a moment and remember, “Holy crap! I’m going to Nationals next year!”



This doesn’t always happen-- sometimes, I’m ruminating for days about what went wrong, what needs to be fixed in training for next time, or why I’m not seeing the gains I worked so hard for in training. It’s a first world problem for sure, but sometimes I can get pretty down the week following a race. The races where everything goes smoothly are rare-- and right now, I’m having a hard time coming up with even one other race where everything went as perfectly as last week. 



My season is not over-- I have one more tri on the schedule, but the priority for rest of the tri season is to simply have fun. I have my first half-marathon on the calendar for early November (eek!!!), and the training for that starts in a couple of weeks. 



So I took the week off. Almost. I did go to track workout on Tuesday with my TriFaster group, but even though I still pushed the 400 workout, I took it easier during warm ups and cool downs and allowed myself more rest. Other than that, I skipped yoga (but still taught nine classes), ate whatever I wanted (I’m usually stricter about avoiding gluten and dairy), got a massage, and only allowed myself fun workouts with family. 



It is important for me to do this. I start making training a priority in January, building my base, and by March I’m following a training plan, checking off workouts one by one, day by day. Aside from family and work, workouts take a priority over pretty much everything else. It is important for me to get away from that mindset even for a week for a few reasons:



The body needs rest. I’ve been learning over the years that gains happen during recovery. If you don’t allow your body to recover, you can’t push harder the next workout. Before I started working with Lauren, my coach, I pushed every single workout going out hard with 100% effort all the time. When I started her training program, I felt at times like I wasn’t working hard enough. Then I starting seeing my times drop, and I realized I was working more efficiently and was able to give more to hard workouts. 

Injury prevention is also a biggie here. The more we avoid rest, the more likely we become prone to injury. Balancing a year with training and not training, building a base and then adding intense workouts week by week, and allowing training weeks to be filled with hard effort workouts and low-intensity workouts are all part of the balance athletes need to remain strong and healthy. 

The mind needs rest. Let’s face it. Working out, checking off the boxes can be addicting. The high after finishing a workout feels so good, and then I begin to crave it. However, it’s important to me to take a break from the mentality that every day I have to check a box and get a workout in. I need to be able to give myself the freedom from not having to wonder how I’m going to fit in a run, bike or swim. For me, a healthy relationship with training means that I can step away from it for a period of time and be okay with it. 



This is not easy for me. Even on our family bike ride on Saturday morning, we were on a trail with cyclists. I wanted to be pushing hard! I wanted to be training on my road bike! I had to remind myself that soon enough, I’d be back in that saddle, and I put myself back in the present moment with my kids. I sometimes sacrifice exercise experiences with my kids for training, and I know that in order to foster a family love for sport, it’s important we do it together.

Finally, rest is out of my comfort zone. I’d happily take a strong flow yoga class, even when I know I need restorative yoga. A weekend morning on the couch reading a book feels like torture-- I should be doing something more productive! I have a hard time sitting down before 8 p.m. It’s important to force myself to do it every once in awhile-- a week now, and a month or two at the end of the year. By the end of the rest period, I can finally relax into it, but am also ready to get back into the groove. 



Now that the rest week is over, I’m sitting with my detox tea and green smoothie ready to plan my workouts for the week. I feel energized and refreshed and ready to hit the ground running again. My next real rest probably won’t happen until after my ½ marathon in November-- but by then, I’ll be ready for it.
