  I'm so excited to teach the inaugural THAT Yoga classes at THAT Conference
  next week at the Kalahari Resort in Wisconsin Dells. If you are attending the
  conference and are on the fence about waking up at 6:00 a.m. to practice yoga
  with us, maybe I can convince you to give it a try. I can't promise you'll be
  jumping into handstands (I still can't), but I can promise you'll get a great
  stretch, learn a little bit more about the practice, and learn why savasana is
  everyone's favorite pose.

Last summer, while I was in the middle of my yoga teacher training program, I was teaching a 5 week yoga session at Centare, where my husband worked at the time. I offered to lead a class to those in the class who were attending THAT conference. One person decided to take me up on that offer and we headed outside to practice in the grass at 6:00 a.m. 



It was a beautiful morning practicing yoga in the grass literally saluting the sun as it rose higher in the sky. We finished up our practice, lying in savasana listening to peaceful music and the sounds of the birds (and semi-trucks whizzing by on the freeway). 



Little did I know that Clark was approaching us while we were in savasana, swearing under his breath thinking it was campers passed out on the grass from the night before. When he got closer to us and realized what was actually going on, he was not only relieved he didn’t have a problem on his hands, but also realized that bringing yoga to campers may not be a bad idea. 



Another organizer passed by us and also tweeted about it. Clark assembled a small group of us, and THAT Yoga began!

So I know what you’re thinking: why yoga? We’re all busy people, with not enough hours in the day, so why should I make space for yoga? Do I have to wear the pants? Will you make me put my legs behind my head? Will I have to chant? My mother-in-law does yoga and she’s crazy. 



The answers to all these questions in the following order: Because it will make you a more productive, smarter, and kinder person. Ditto for the second question. And no, but only if you want to. Yikes--No, unless you want a hip replacement. And no. Yoga is for everybody, even crazy mother-in-laws.  



The truth is that yoga really came into my life when I desperately needed an outlet.I had practiced before, taking classes here and there, but when my oldest daughter turned three months old in September of 2008 and wasn’t going back to my job as a classroom teacher, I sort of had an identity crisis. Who am I now that I’m not a teacher? Who am I now that I hang out in my pajamas all day and don’t talk to anyone that can talk back to me? Why do the hosts of NPR’s _All Things Considered_ suddenly feel like my new BFF’s? 



My husband suggested casually that I start taking yoga again to “get out of the house.” And from there, it just became my thing. The changes were gradual. Not only did my body become stronger, but I started sleeping better (as much as you can with a three month old). I started becoming aware of my thoughts and becoming more present in the moment. I started practicing self-care: listening to what my body and mind needed and acting on it. I learned how to put myself first so I could better take care of others. I am still learning to silence the inner critic. 



Yoga has changed my life for the better. Ten years into this consistent practice (yes, I still go to the same class that I started taking 10 years ago), I still can’t pop into a handstand, but I can do things that I never thought I could. I have learned to insulate my live wire-- creating space between life experiences (good and bad) and my reaction to them. I can give you facts and statistics about how with a regular practice your memory improves, you can live longer, get better sleep, etc. but you can look up those statistics on your own. Truthfully, that’s just the icing on the cake after taking a class and feeling so good after. Try it; you’ll see.
