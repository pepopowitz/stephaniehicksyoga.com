  'Tis the season for race recaps! It's another doozy in terms of length, but
  really was one of those fairy-tale races worth writing about for so many
  reasons. This was triathlon number 25 for me, the 10th time doing IronGirl,
  and the third time I've qualified for USAT Age Group National Championships.

“There was a dream and one day I could see it

Like a bird in a cage I broke in 

And demanded that somebody free it”

\--Avett Brothers

In December 2017, I interviewed a few triathlon coaches because I reached a plateau in my training and racing. This is a whole separate topic for a blog post that I’ll write about at a later date, but the short story is that I chose Lauren Jensen for my coach. I sat down with her in early January of 2018 and told her that my goal was to qualify for nationals every year, and not just to fly in by the seat of my pants but to solidly make that top 10% of a qualifying race, eventually even making it to the top three in my age group. My initial goals were to either get back to Nationals in 2018 (risky goal) or to make it in 2019. We hashed out a plan, and she put me to work. 

I signed up for Elkhart Lake Sprint, as usual, and told Lauren I would love to qualify for nationals at that race, but knew it was a long shot. I would have to drop at least 8 minutes off my time, which is a ridiculous goal in one year for a sprint triathlon. I worked my butt off though, and even though I made great strides shaving almost four minutes off my time, apparently everyone else in my age group did, too, because I still finished 7th out of 33? In my age group. 

Reassessing my goals after that race, I knew Iron Girl was going to be my best chance to qualify for nationals. Lauren sent me another training plan with the disclaimer that it was filled with some serious workouts and I was supposed to do the best I could. I also signed up for group track workouts with TriFaster, her training group. 

I busted my butt. Her plan called for seven workouts a week, and I executed 87.5% of those workouts (yes, a post about my obsession with data to follow). Even if I missed a workout, I was still teaching an average of seven yoga classes a week, so I chose listening to my body and resting over some workouts. 

There were highs and lows, as always, and a practice race at Tri-ing for Children’s (see previous blog post for the recap). 

Earlier last week, I had two work conferences-- one at the beginning of the week where I taught a 6:00 a.m. yoga class Monday through Wednesday, and my annual work conference in Tomahawk. Through the years, I’ve noticed that if I take the week off doing minimal workouts, I function better on race day. Luckily, my schedule allowed me to take it easy teaching only three yoga classes,  doing one run Thursday morning up in Tomahawk, and a shake-out bike Saturday morning. 

The week before I was remarkably confident. I’m in the best shape I’ve ever been in, and I knew especially I was going to shave off time on the bike. Putting together my goals for this race, I shot for a sub 1:20 race, knowing that anything can happen on race day. My previous PR on this course was 1:21:34, and dropping a minute and a half could be seen as a little conservative, but I wanted to finish the race happy knowing that I set and reached an achievable goal. The days leading up to the race I focused on a mindset of celebration-- using the race to celebrate my accomplishments of hard work and executing my training plan. 

The day before the race, Steve and I decided to do a shake out bike ride. As we were getting ready to leave, Steve was pumping up my bike tire and found a slash in the sidewall of my front tire. I decided to ride on it and take the chance. When we got home from our ride, the tire was definitely bulging and I knew that I was risking a flat on the course. Steve took a trip to the bike store and changed my tire. There’s an old wives tale that once you change a tire, you flat out three times in the next month. I crossed my fingers and knocked on wood. I knew I just had to go with it (or roll with it, insert eye roll). 

We packed up and headed to Pleasant Prairie by early afternoon. We checked into the expo, I racked my bike, and then we headed to the hotel to let the girls swim in the pool. I found myself checking out all the fancy bikes and wondering what my competition was going to look like. I try to erase those thoughts from my head-- I have no control over who shows up. I can only control my own race. That sentiment was on auto-play in my brain. We ended up going out to dinner with my inlaws around 4:45 (so early!) at Tuscan Bistro in Pleasant Prairie. I had gluten-free pasta with prosciutto, mushrooms (it was so good!) and a glass of rose. 

Steve’s parents took the girls for the night and we were back by the hotel by 6:00 p.m. We were both so tired we literally crawled into bed and watched TV and read. It felt so weird! After hours of binging on HGTV I fell asleep around 9:30 and had a great night of sleep, which as I’ve mentioned in earlier blog posts is a bit of an anomaly for me. There were no anxious dreams, no restlessness-- I felt calm and strong and ready to execute early the next morning!

Sunday morning the alarm went off at 4:45 and I started getting ready. I made my Picky Bar Apple flavored oatmeal, and brewed some coffee (I normally don’t drink caffeine, so this was a little out of my comfort zone), and we headed out a little after 5. We got to the race site, found a close parking spot and I set up my transition area. I was about to head out to find my childhood friend Steph (who I’ve done the race with before) when I heard someone scream my name and run right up to me. It was her! We hugged and screamed and hugged again. And then we headed to the porta potty line. 

The rest of the morning before the race literally consisted of us talking each other’s ears off as we stood in line for porta potties. Gone were the butterflies, and all hopes for a pre-race warm up. Instead it was catching up on our lives and non-stop chatter. For the first time ever, we were in the same wave, which was great because I knew she would push me on the swim. We saw a few other familiar faces, gave lots of hugs, and got in line for our wave. I love this part of the race-- walking waist deep into the water, looking across the lake as the sun rises, feeling strong and focused and ready to burst into the water. 

And finally, we were off. I knew that Steph was going to push me to go out hard as she bolted ahead of me right away. Per usual, I race my own race, settling into a maintainable pace-- pushing, but not maxing out my effort. About half way through the swim, I caught sight of Steph off to my right, breast-stroking every few breaths and settling back into freestyle. By the sight of her stroke (smooth and pretty!), I knew it was her. I kept her in my sight for a few minutes and then eventually pulled ahead. 

What I like about the swim is that the drop off is steep, meaning that you can literally swim right up to the shore and climb up out of the water. As I climbed the sandy hill and looked at my watch, I realized I was in good shape-- not as fast as two years ago, but by less than 10 seconds. I saw my family and smiled at them. Then I shot into transition and it was fast! I ran my bike out of T1 as I heard Steph yelling, “Go Hicks!” and I yelled a cheer her way. 

I got off to a good start on the bike-- I decided I was going to aim to drink a sip of Nuun every mile and then take a GU about 35-40 minutes in. I felt fast-- passing people more than I was passed. Feeling Steph on my tail, I pushed hard on the bike. I eventually started playing a game of catch and mouse with a woman named Dawn, and we started chatting with each other pushing each other forward. I love that! We cheered for other ladies on the course, and I only pulled ahead of her in the last mile coming into T2. I saw the girls, Steve and my inlaws and heard them yelling for me. My goal was to be under 35 minutes, and I would have made it if the chute where I had to dismount and run my bike was shorter. It felt amazing!

T2 was also fast. I felt the need to grab a swig of Nuun, just like I did at Ottawa Lake, but decided against it. As I ran out of T2, I saw Steve and the girls. Steve started running with me, and yelled, “Leave it all on the course!” At that point, I almost started crying. I could feel the tears welling up but I just kept trucking. I needed that reminder that this is the most significant leg of the race for me-- this is where I have to draw the deep reserves of strength and allow myself to drain my energy bucket. I know that what will come ahead will hurt. 

I didn’t allow myself to even think about my overall time. I was looking at people and pegging them off one at a time, but cheering for them at the same time. Lauren advised me to hold back in my first half mile and then slowly build, but I was having trouble getting my heart rate down. I started at an 8:45 mm which was fine, but by that ½ mile mark, I knew my heart rate wasn’t going down-- it was going to stay in zone 5, so I just had to keep pushing. By the end of mile 1, my pace was dropping and I finished at an 8:44. In my planning, I was hoping to start around an 8:30, then drop 10-15 seconds per mile, ending below 8:00. At some point, listening to my body, all that goes out the window, and I just go by feel. In mile 2, we hit an out and back on gravel, which always slows me down, but I kept my focus and ended mile two at an 8:42 mm pace. 

Lauren told me that at mile 2, I needed to let it all out. As that mile started, I was still on gravel, and all I kept thinking was, “Let that bird out of the cage and fly! Free yourself of negativity, free yourself from self-limiting beliefs like, “I’m not a warrior” and then f’ing be the warrior! Be the winner you want to be!” I saw Steph and yelled, “Fly mama, fly!!” I turned onto the pavement trail again and started running that last leg. A woman passed me and said, “We have so far to go!” and at that point, I couldn’t respond. I thought she was pretty damn fast to be saying that. I picked up my pace, and looked at my watch-- 1 hour 16 minutes. I knew I was close, and I felt like stopping. I kept thinking, “Keep pushing-- feel like you want to puke until the end. Empty the bucket.” So that’s what I did. I didn’t let any one pass me (remembering a disappointing finish two years ago) and instead gained on others. Mile 3 was 8:14, and my last .12 of mile was at a 6:40 pace. I crossed the finish line, knowing indeed, that I did leave everything out there. There was no doubt. 

I grabbed a water bottle, and immediately headed to Steve and the girls. Lila came running up to me right away and led me over to them. We hugged and then I went back to the finish line to cheer on Steph. As I looked at my time, I realized that I finished fast! 1:18:46-- crazy! 1:14 faster than my goal pace! As it settled in, Steph and other friends crossed the line and I cheered so hard. We kept cheering for others as they finished, and at one point, I headed back over to Steve and he said, “You are in 5th place in your age group!” I couldn’t believe it. At that point, I knew I was going back to Nationals. It was the icing on the cake. 

The rest of the morning was spent celebrating with friends, old and new, drinking beer from The Lone Girl Brewery, and taking lots of pictures. This was seriously one of my most fun races. I used the race to celebrate my training, didn’t take the rest of it too seriously, and mostly had so much fun! I was able to take in the scenery and enjoy the view, and to be present in the race, even the difficult parts. For my 25th overall triathlon and 10th Iron Girl, it had to be epic, and it certainly was.

P.S. Coming
 full circle-- that night we went to see the Avett Brothers at the Riverside in Milwaukee. They didn't play "Head Full of Doubt/Road Full of Promise," but it was the perfect end to that epic day-- and my legs even held out for dancing!
