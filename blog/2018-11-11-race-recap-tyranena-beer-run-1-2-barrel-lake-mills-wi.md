  Here's a recap of my first half-marathon! It was a beautiful day on a
  beautiful course, and I learned lots of lessons about racing a half. I was so
  close to achieving my goal, and I have a few ideas about how I can improve my
  training and racing for next time. As always, thanks for reading!

My first half marathon! Coming into this race, I set the “scary goal” (cue air quotes) of hitting a sub 2:00 hour ½ marathon. Everything about setting a time goal for a first race went against everything I believed in and advised others, but how often do we listen to our own advice? 



Training for this race went pretty smoothly. I had a few hiccups in the beginning-- running five days a week in the first week proved a little too much and I had to visit my PT. She advised me to only run 3-4 days a week and I took that advice to heart. For the majority of my training, I ran four to five miles twice a week, and then did my long run on the weekends. I was pretty busy this fall, so I didn’t cross-train at all. Looking back, that felt like a mistake. 



Towards the end of the training, however, I swapped a few of my weekly runs for tempo/pacing runs. On all of these runs, I nailed the workout in the training, but was still skeptical of how that would translate to race day. A four or seven mile speed workout is a lot different than running 13.1 miles!



The week before the race, I trolled the weather, and it looked great. The nice thing about this race is that it starts at 11:30 a.m., heading into the warmest part of the day. The weather ended up being 43 degrees and sunny at the start, with little to no wind-- perfect racing conditions!



We left our house around 9:30 a.m. with my Picky Oats in hand. I made a smoothie when I woke up and ate the Picky Oats en route to Lake Mills. I packed three GU’s and had Nuun in my hand-held water bottle. 



Steve and I parked next to the tent (with the disclaimer that we had to stay until 3:30 to park in the field), and then went into the Tyranena brewery to pick up our packets. We ran into a few friends and chatted for a bit, and then went to our car to pick up our GU’s and water bottles and decide on our clothing choices. I made a few porta potty trips and took a picture with the Oiselle team (I joined the Volee back in August). 



About five minutes before the start, I took a GU and then Steve and I went to line up. We started in the back of the pack. Earlier in the week, I had created a pace plan for myself to start out with the first three miles at a 9:25 minute mile pace, then the next three at a 9:15 mm pace, then drop to 9:05 for the next three, and then 8:55 for the last three. Pacing the first 12 miles here would allow me 10:00 minutes for the last 1.10 miles, which at that point would be slowing down a bit to finish. 



However, as the horn blew, that all fell out the window, and I started running just by feel-- just see how it goes! What I noticed immediately was the back of the pack started at a leisurely pace, which I loved-- it felt so good to start a manageable pace for this distance instead of most of the racing that I do where I feel like I have to blast off right away. The beginning of the race had us running through scenic downtown Lake Mills enjoying the fall colors on the trees, and it made me grateful I had signed up for the race. I was running a ½ marathon!!



What I noticed almost immediately within the first mile was two things: one, I was going to get hot wearing my long-sleeved pullover (even though it was pretty lightweight), and two, the top left safety pin had somehow fallen off my race bib so it was loose and hanging a bit. In my head, I wished that I had pinned my bib to my tank top underneath, and maybe not worn my Girls on the Run hat. If I were to do another 45 degree ½ marathon again, I would probably wear capris and a long sleeve shirt that I could rip off and leave on the ground. One of my friends mentioned a few weeks ago that she always strips a layer after the first hour of a half-marathon because being cold makes her run faster. I will definitely keep this in mind for the future!



For the first three miles, I went out a little fast-- it is hard for me not to peg people off as I run, and I should have held back. What I aimed to be 9:25 mile splits ended up being 9:24, 9:12, and 9:10. I was feeling good though, so I played with maintaining what I hoped would be slightly above my goal finish pace of 9:09 mm. 



There were two significant hills in the next three miles that I was worried about going into the race, but were pretty easy compared to what I’m used to. I’m glad I train on hills! They were steep but quick, and I was happy to pass a lot of people on them. My next three miles I was hoping to average a 9:15 mm pace, and ended up with 9:23 (the hills!), 8:53, and 9:13. These three miles were on a really pretty part of the course along the lake. 



Somewhere around mile 6, I spotted my yoga student, Lowell, ahead of me. He was the one who encouraged me and Steve to sign up for this race because of the fun atmosphere and beautiful course. I kept my eyes on his neon yellow jacket, but could tell that he was keeping a good pace. At one point, we turned onto the packed gravel path of the Glacial Drumlin Trail and I caught him. He mentioned that he was hurting a bit from a 15K he had done the week before and told me to go ahead. I ran with him for a bit longer and then pulled ahead and ran with a couple of other women-- we chatted a bit about IronMan tri’s (one of the woman had done a few of them and had a tattoo on her arm) but mostly stayed silent keeping pace with each other for a mile or two. The goal for these next three miles was to maintain a 9:05 minute mile pace and I hit an 8:56, 9:10, and 9:13mm. I was still feeling strong at this point.



Sometime after mile 9 I started doing the math. I was around 1:22-23 minutes in and a goal of 4.1 miles in 37 minutes was not unrealistic. At this point, if I had been following my pace plan, I would be wanting to hit sub 9:00 minute miles (8:55 in my plan). However, I knew I was a little ahead of this, so the goal was still manageable. But this is when things started to fall apart a little bit. I had been on the trail for the last few miles, but then we did an out and back and it turned into an industrial park. I had taken a GU 45 minutes in, and then around 1:30:00 it was time to take another one. In hindsight, my next GU should have been around 1:20 because it felt a little too late. I was starting to crash. 





The last three miles are slightly uphill, and at a certain point, I came to the realization that I wasn’t going to make my goal. This is when things started getting mentally tough. People started to pass me where before I was passing them, and then Lowell came up behind me and asked how I was doing. My response was something like, “I’m falling apart.” I pulled out my Run Gum (a last resort) and saw a woman ahead of me running, then walking, then running again. I thought to myself, “Maybe I should do that, too,” but just never let myself stop. In my head I wondered if I would just stop and get my heart rate down and catch my breath, would I be able to finish strong? But I just kept going and never allowed myself to do that. Miles 9-12 with a goal pace of 8:55 minute miles were 9:12, 9:40, and 10:05. 



That last mile really was my hardest. I had to dig deep knowing I wasn’t going to make my goal. The hard part was also not knowing the course and how it ended. I wished I could see the finish line so I knew how long I had left. When I finally turned the corner to the brewery, Steve asked if he could run with me-- I honestly didn’t even recognize him I was so in my head. Seeing my girls also gave me the burst of energy and I wished I had seen them sooner! I pushed that final stretch and crossed the finish line with an official time of 2:02:49. 

 

The post-race atmosphere was really fun! They provided lasagna and beer tickets in the heated tent. Steve and I stuck around for a couple of hours. Realistically, I was happy that I finished, but bummed that I was so close to achieving my goal and not hitting it. 



Here are the main lessons I learned for next time:



Gear: Pinning my bib to my tank top knowing I’m going to heat up and wearing a throwaway layer (something I don’t care about finding again. I’ve heard people stick $20 with their address in a jacket, so that’s an option, too!). I spent some energy thinking about how hot I was!

Follow my pace plan. I think it would have made a difference. I basically hit that goal pace in mile 2-3 already, and I feel like I would have saved myself some agony if I would have held back and been a bit more conservative in those first three miles. 

Take GU #3 earlier. I took one five minutes before the race, and 45 minutes in. At times in training, I realized I would have benefitted from my third at about 1:20:00, and I think waiting ten minutes was too late for me. 

Cross training more-- two hour bike rides and two hours in the pool just to get that feeling of exercising for two hours at a time. My 11 mile run was my longest distance and it took us under 1:45. After mile 11 I kept saying to myself, this is the longest I’ve ever run! Exciting, but I wished I had a few 2 hour cross-training sessions to maintain that solid endurance I had in my tri season. 



Overall, I’m excited to race this distance again. I’d like to find a flatter course, and one that doesn’t end on an uphill! I would also like to race Tyranena again, too, so that is on our radar for next year.



It’s been a week since this race ended, and I’m excited to get back in the pool and get on my bike again. As much as I love running, I miss the others, too, and I’m focusing my energy on figuring out my next big goal for 2019. Stay tuned!
