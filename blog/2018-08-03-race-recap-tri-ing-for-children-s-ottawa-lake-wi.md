  Here's a recap from my most recent sprint triathlon, Tri-ing for Children's in
  Ottawa Lake, Wisconsin, July 29, 2018. While this race was a sprint, this blog
  post is along the line of a half-Ironman, folks, so thanks in advance for
  reading!

For the past couple of years, this race has been on our radar. It falls on our anniversary weekend, and for some reason or another, we have happened to hit this park on a Sunday of our anniversary, either on our way home from a weekend in Madison, or last year as a stop on our way back from canoe camping. We’ve seen the race directors tearing down the transition area and thought it would be a fun and pretty course. 

Well, this was our year. We signed up for it as I wanted a practice race a couple of weeks before IronGirl (one of my two A races this year) and Steve wanted to race an Olympic distance. It is part of the [Wisconsin Tri Series](http://witriseries.com/) and we’ve done a few of these races before (Devil’s Lake Challenge in 2016 and Sugar River Tri in 2017). What we know about these races is that they are super competitive and many of the participants sign up for the whole series. In the past, I’ve finished in the middle (Sugar River) to the back of the pack (Devil’s Challenge) in my age group. 

Since the venue is about 45 minutes away, we debated on staying either at Steve’s parents’ house in Oconomowoc, about 20ish minutes away, getting a hotel room in Delafield, or staying at home. We decided to save the money and stay at home. The transition area opened at 5:45 a.m., so we thought that if we left by 5:15, we’d make it there early enough. Since I wake up at 4:45 a.m. on Fridays for my sunrise yoga class, I had an aversion to setting my alarm for 4:45 and set it to 5:00. Definitely a mistake. 

We had a pretty chill evening the night before at home, grilling out chicken and veggies and renting The Disaster Artist. I was in bed before 10 and slept really well, which is kind of an anomaly for me for the night before a race. I woke up at 5:00 and got ready to go. I made Picky Oats “How ‘Bout Dem Apples” and added a couple of brazil nuts to it. We grabbed our water bottles from the fridge (our gear was already packed) and left around 5:20 a.m.

We arrived about a mile away from the state park and traffic was backed up like crazy. It was moving, albeit slowly, and we both were in need of a bathroom. The minutes ticked away-- Steve was getting frustrated, and I really needed a bathroom stop. We realized we were probably not going to get in our run/bike warm up, which was a bummer because it really helps loosen up my muscles. As we approached the park, cars in front of us were stopping to let out people with their bikes which was a little annoying. We’ve seen this before and it just slows things down. At one point Steve yelled and pounded on the steering wheel, which was not fun. Finding a bathroom was still on the forefront of my mind. That was also not fun.

We finally made it into the parking lot, and people were parking pretty haphazardly. Steve filled up our bike tires with air, and we started jogging to the transition area. At this point it was close to 6:30/40 and the transition area was set to close at 6:45. As we approached the transition area, they made the announcement that they were delaying the close of transition (and thus the start of the race) by 15 minutes. We stopped at a bathroom (finally), but then were frustrated to find it was locked. We got body marked with our race numbers, entered transition and starting setting up our gear. 

I quickly (furiously!) set everything up, and then hunted down the porta potties. The 10 porta potties. With a line of probably 200 people-- I don’t know. It snaked the length of the parking lot, and then wrapped around the lot forming a long L shape. At this point, we were getting close to 7, and Steve was supposed to start at 7:09 a.m. We heard another announcement that the race was delayed-- again. Sigh of relief. 

We finally made it through the porta potty line and I helped Steve put his wetsuit on. As he was zipping up he stuffed his GU’s into his jersey. At that point, I realized that I had forgotten my GU in the transition area-- I usually try to take one five minutes before I start to race for a little kick. Not really a big deal, but a note to self to not forget it next time. Steve rushed off to jump into his wave, and I had time to kill so I walked back to the porta potty line one more time. This time it was a bit shorter, but not by much. I made it through in about 15 minutes and headed towards the start line. I tried warming up a little by running a short section in the grass but it felt weird without shoes on, so I decided to sit in the grass for a few minutes and chill out. I was in a good head space-- at a certain point before a race, I pause for a moment to remind myself that racing is such a privilege in so many ways and to use the race to celebrate my hard work in training. I know there are things that can happen that I can’t control, and remind myself to roll with whatever the race will bring.

Finally, they called our wave (40-49 year old women-- the yellow caps!), and we all lined up. It was after 8:00 a.m. 20-30 minutes past my original start time of 7:41. I had to ask a woman what the actual swim course was (oops!) and it looked short. I felt confident lining up for the swim in two feet of water and settled in the front line. The horn blew, and we were off! 

The water was like bath water, which was great since I decided against a wetsuit. The temps in the morning were in the low 60’s so the water felt really warm. It is always a fight to separate from the crowd in the beginning. I ran a few steps and dove right in knowing I was calm and my breathing was under control. Starting in the front does mean that people behind you try to go out too hard and will try to swim on top of you. I didn’t get kicked because I was leading, but I did have people grabbing onto my legs or feet for a little bit longer than I would have liked. I pretty much ride it out, settle into my pace, and keep pushing! The best part of the swim was having someone swimming next to me pushing me to swim faster. She kept me moving faster, the competitor in me fought to stay ahead of her (and I did), and as we ran out of the swim I congratulated her on a great swim and then sprinted ahead. I saw my coach as I ran up the beach and she called out to me (she was there coaching Team Phoenix, a group of breast cancer survivors). I saw one other yellow cap in front of me, so I knew I was in good shape coming out of the swim and felt strong.

T1 felt fast. There is always a little bit of shakiness as I pull on my socks and shoes, but other than that, I grabbed everything I needed and bolted out of the transition area. I was passing a line of people heading out and felt confident. 

I jumped on my bike, turned on my bike computer, turned on my bike computer again, and what?! No bike computer! Steve had just changed the battery the day before so something must have happened because it was dead. Blank screen. Not the biggest deal since I have my Garmin tracking my time, speed and distance, but it just meant having to flick my wrist every minute or so to double check my stats. A little more inconvenient, but again, an easy fix for the next race. The first few miles of the race were tricky as the one single lane highway was divided into thirds-- two lanes for runners on the out and back course and one lane for bikers. That meant the riders had only three to four feet of lane which made it tricky for passing. Generally, people pass on the left and when you’re coming up on someone you say “On your left” and they move toward the right. As I was coming up on a slower rider, I kept repeating, “On your left” and she didn’t budge. Finally, she yelled, “I don’t want you to pass me on the left-- go right!” (which is illegal), but heading to the right were the cones set up to divide the road. I had to trail behind her for a minute or so before I was able to get into a position to pass. It must have been her first race, and I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but it was definitely frustrating in the moment.

After that, the ride was uneventful. The roads were bumpy, but the course itself was beautiful following country roads and cutting through farm fields. Cows mooed, the breeze gently blew, expensive tri bikes whizzed by, but I got into a comfortable and fast pace for me, averaging over 18 miles an hour. There were a couple of people who I ended up riding with, and it’s fun to have those people around to push me. I only engaged in a tiny bit of conversation with a Team Tri Faster member-- the group that I train with, and mostly focused on keeping my pace. I took a gel (GU Chocolate Coconut) at about 35 minutes in, and tried to drink plenty of fluid (but fell short of finishing a whole bottle on the ride). I flew into T2 a little bit behind two of the 3 people in our pack.

T2 also felt good-- I quickly changed shoes, traded my helmet for my race hat, and threw on my race belt. I took a swig of Nuun because I was feeling thirsty-- not a great sign, and ran out of transition. I hit my watch, but must have not hit it enough because it registered as T2 instead of run. It took me a little bit to realize this and then I hit it again about 14 seconds into my run. 

The final leg! We ran through a parking lot and then through wet grassy prairie trail to get to the road. I started off at about an 8:30 pace and felt solid. In my head I was thinking I would just negative split, so I settled in to the pace. I came out onto the road and ran into Jenny, my track group coach, and she yelled, “Looking strong! Wow! You’re running a fast pace!” At this point, I was still running an 8:30, so in my head I just didn't believe it, but I thanked her and kept moving. It is so invigorating to see a friendly face on the course! I just wanted to be faster, but knowing I still had two miles in me was not ready to push if further yet. I was mainly passing people, but getting passed, too. At one point, I saw one of the women who I was biking with, and worked on catching up to her. I passed her at the turnaround, just before mile 2, and was too tired to say anything to her. Somehow, mile 2 ended up being 8:33, three seconds slower than mile one. At the start of mile 3, I started to pick up the pace. I opened up my pack of Run Gum, and worked on picking up speed. I saw Jenny and heard her cheering for me again, and I wanted to be moving faster! I needed water, but when I passed the aid station the guy who was holding water out suddenly took his hand away. I almost stopped and then thought, “Screw it. I’ll drink at the finish.” After that we were back in a narrow lane grass again, and I really slowed down. At one point, I looked at my watch and I was at 9:30mm. Yikes! I picked it up and when I saw pavement again, started really booking it knowing the finish was close. As I ran that last leg, in my head I was thinking I still had juice left ( which really means that I wasn’t feeling like I wanted to die), so I should have been picking it up earlier. I finished strong though, and felt like it was an important lesson-- push earlier so you feel like you want to die at the finish.

Overall, when I finished and looked at the time I was disappointed. I don’t know where I was expecting to finish since I try hard not to set serious times for a first race, but I think I was expecting more from my run. However, after time set in, I realized I had a pretty fantastic swim, bike (lots of improvement--18.6 mph is my fastest yet!), and T1. I just need to push more on that run. The further removed I am from this race, the better I feel about my performance that day. It was fun cheering Steve on to the finish (usually it’s the other way around), and inspiring to cheer on the women I know from Team Phoenix. We’re not sure we’re going to do this one again for various reasons, but at the end of the day, we were lucky to be out there on a beautiful day, pushing our own boundaries, learning lessons, and doing what we love.
