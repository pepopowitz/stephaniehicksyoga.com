  Lessons learned from my first season racing and training with a coach. I took
  a big leap of faith and it paid off. My tri season is officially over, so here
  are some final thoughts about how the season went.

I’m almost two weeks removed from my race season, and I am slightly (not so slightly!) going through race withdrawal. Just yesterday, the weather was 80 degrees and I wanted to get on my bike and even contemplated an outdoor swim at the WAC. I thought to myself, “How am I ever going to wait until May to do another race?!”



But all this is good; still having the itch to race puts me in a good place as I train for my half-marathon next month. When I look back to this time last year, I had taken 2nd place in my age group at the Raider Nation Triathlon so I was happy about that finish, but I really felt as though I plateaued in my racing. After a few disappointing finishes at races, including Age Group Nationals in Omaha, I knew that I had reached an impasse. I could keep following the same training plan, finishing about the same, or I could shake things up a bit and step out of my comfort zone. 



Change is slow for me, and I am resistant to it. There is this banter of negative self-talk and excuse-making going on in my head, but eventually, I got around to convincing myself to move forward. I experienced this with my yoga teacher training program the fall before, and it was life-changing, so why not take a leap of faith with triathlon? “What’s the worst that could happen?” I asked myself. I could pay for a coach, not see any progress, and then discontinue working with him/her. Or I could put myself out there and see what could happen. It was nerve-wracking and exciting all at the same time. 



While I was contemplating all this, I had a tarot card reading done as a gift from my yoga teacher training leaders, and one of the main points of the reading was that I needed to change things that were no longer working for me. Work more efficiently was one of the key take-aways, as well as working on my self-doubt and negative self-talk. I translated these ideas to a number of things in my life, but realized it was in alignment with what was happening in my relationship to triathlon. 



I contacted Coach Lauren in the fall, and we decided we would meet at the beginning of January. I laid out my goals for the year: to qualify at Nationals and to increase my speed on the run and the bike. She suggested I start with a bike class at Wheel and Sprocket in Brookfield-- again, I came up with excuses in my head: I train alone! Spin is just fine! But I made myself do it, and Steve came along. The class was fun, and we met a lot of great people. I could feel myself getting faster and stronger. Lauren challenged me to work more efficiently, not necessarily harder. The workouts were challenging, but not impossible. I felt like I was making progress. 



My first race was in Whitewater at the beginning of May. It was the first race I went to all alone. The race also prepared me for what I could expect at Elkhart Lake, my first goal race for the season. My bike was getting faster, but because of that, my run was suffering. I had my first ever first place finish in my age group despite a tough and somewhat ‘meh’ finish. My hard work was beginning to pay off.





As mentioned earlier, one of my goals was to try to get back to Nationals in 2018. This would mean qualifying at Elkhart Lake and would take an 8 minute drop off my sprint PR at that race. Realistically speaking, I knew that achieving that goal would be a long shot. I knew that I had to just get out there and race it and see what would happen. Even though I shaved almost four minutes off my time, I still placed 7th in my age group-- the same place I earned the year before. That race taught me that progress is slow moving, but if I can shave almost four minutes in one year, I can come even closer to my goal of placing in that top 10% in years to come. 



I had one more training race in Ottawa Lake, Tri-ing for Children’s, that was brutal. Again, I had a faster bike and run, but progress was snail slow. Since this was the first time I had done this race, I had nothing to compare it to, but I struggled big time on the run and the race was super competitive. I knew that in a few weeks, at IronGirl, I was going to have to leave everything on the course. I was taking the lessons I was learning and applying them to my upcoming races. In the past, I pushed every workout, every race-- in short, I overtrained and overraced-- and didn't take the time to use a race as a practice scenario. 



IronGirl was my playground. It was finally the time to take all that hard work and show myself what could happen. I didn’t feel the pressure I had felt in years past because I felt so well prepared for it. I treated it as a celebration of my hard work and had my best finish ever-- 5th out of 92 in my age group. And I made it to Nationals for 2019--woot woot!!  Finishing in the top 3 became a new goal for the future.



At that point, anything beyond qualifying for Nationals was icing on the cake. I ended the season at the Raider Nation Triathlon with my second 1st place in my age group finish. As opposed to the J-Hawk tri, where I just walked up to the race director to receive my award, I actually got to climb on top of a podium in front of 100 plus people in the bleachers of my high school. It was a full circle moment-- the best way to end my season.



To take chances training with a coach, to try new things like bike/run interval classes and early morning group track workouts, to trust someone else’s plan-- those things were not easy for me. I learned that progress doesn’t come quickly; it comes in slow doses after months of hard work. I learned that achieving big goals doesn’t take just that hard work, but also knowledge. You can’t achieve a big goal without the knowledge of how to get there. 



I posted on my Instagram after my last race, that I’m not taking 2018 for granted. I took a leap out of my comfort zone and I gained so much. As I reflect on this past season, I know my work is not done. Truthfully, it is just getting started. I’ve got some big goals swimming in my head for 2019 and beyond, and all I know for sure is that progress doesn’t happen without taking some big leaps of faith. And after a little bit of rest, I’m getting ready to jump!
