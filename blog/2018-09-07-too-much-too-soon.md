  When I look at a new paper copy of a training plan for a race, it always makes
  me wonder what the journey will bring. Well, this trip started out with a
  bang, speeding through the stop lights, but then hit a detour. What happened?
  And when will I get back on the road again?

I thought I was being smart. The week before my half-marathon training began, I was still easing back into workouts after a rest week post-Iron Girl Tri. I ran a little over nine miles, and knowing that my training plan called for 20 miles the first week, I knew I had to hold back. I planned on completing most of the workouts, but really scaling back the mileage from 20 to closer to 15. Smart, right?!



And so it began. I biked and ran 1.21 miles on Sunday and counted that as my cross-training day. 



I ran an easy peaceful 3.06 miles on Monday at 6:00 a.m. 



On Tuesday, my 5:45 a.m. track workout was cancelled because of storms, but I still managed to take the girls to Hart Park track and run 4x400’s and 2x800’s. (I even held back and only did two 800’s instead of four.) Mileage: 2.91



Tuesday night, my good friend Ann and I texted to schedule our runs for the week-- one on Wednesday morning and another Thursday morning. In my head, I initially wondered if this was too much? We usually go between 4-5 miles and I thought for a second that this might be too much, too soon. But I was so excited to resume our runs (we haven’t run together since May), that I quickly dismissed those thoughts. 



It felt so good to get out there and run with her Wednesday morning-- the weather was rainy (a surprise to both of us), but our 4.5 miles went by fast with our conversation-- venting about the struggles in our lives and lifting each other up. It felt so good to fall back into our routine. 



At some point on Wednesday, I may have noticed a little tenderness in my lower left calf muscle-- the areas of muscle that surround the Achilles just above the ankle. I didn’t think anything of it until I started running Thursday morning. My plan at that point was to run my long run for the week, 5 miles, and then call it quits for the week as I was approaching the 15 mile mark. 



I met up with Ann at 6:05 Thursday morning, and right away noticed that achey tenderness in the muscles surrounding my Achilles. I did my best to ignore it and made it through 5.25 miles. 



15.72 miles for the week. 



As I moved through my day on Thursday, it got worse. Climbing up and down stairs at Meet the Teacher night was becoming difficult. My ankle felt hot and tender to the touch. I was sidelined. 



At that point, I was comfortable resting for the rest of the week. I knew that Friday and Saturday were going to be busy as we were headed out of town, and I was okay taking a couple of rest days since I had gotten my 15 miles in. 



The pain went away, and I was able to climb stairs comfortably again. Starting week 2 of my training plan on Sunday, I went for a 25 mile bike ride around Green Lake with my husband and another friend. I felt strong and fast on the bike, even though I fell off my bike on Hwy 23 in Green Lake as were stopped in the middle of the highway making a left turn. (Insert rolling eyes emoji here.) 



On Labor Day, I decided to go out for a 3.09 mile run, and towards the end of that run, the ankle issue returned. Ugh. 



By the end of the day, it felt fine, so Tuesday morning, I headed out with Ann for another run. I got up early to meet her at 5:50 a.m. and was less than a mile from my house before I knew I had to turn around and head back home. 



I had pushed it too far. 



I’m only in Week 2, and already, my training is on hold. I feel surprisingly okay about this. I can pinpoint where I should have held back, and know what I did wrong. Include more cross-training. Don’t run five days straight coming off a rest. Ease in gently. 



I went to see my acupuncturist today after a 9 month hiatus. As I laid there on the table with needles all over my body, I realized how overdue I was for this kind of self-care-- tight back muscles, psoas, calf muscles-- the laundry list of tightness that made this injury inevitable. 



“How much time do I need to take off from running?” I asked him as my session was wrapping up. 



“This is not a big deal-- I”m not too worried about it,” he began, “but you still need to take a week off and ease back into it.” 



Ease. How often do I forget to do things with ease? How often do I jump right into things because I’m excited or filled with a drive that takes precedence over common sense? How often do I ignore that quiet voice of intuition telling me to hold back, to reconsider, or to think something through? We live in a fast-paced culture, and so I’ve become fast-paced. I was so excited to start this training and do it right, to follow the plan, to execute, execute, execute, that I didn’t stop to think I may have been doing too much too soon. 



So I guess I learned my lesson, and I have a week (or more) to think more about it. To allow myself the time to take care of my body, slow down, and practice easing in with more grace when I resume again. Who knows what this ½ marathon training and race will bring, but in less than two weeks, I’m already gaining valuable lessons, and that makes it all worth it already.
