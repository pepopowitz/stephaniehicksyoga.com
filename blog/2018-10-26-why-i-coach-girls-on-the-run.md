  Here is a piece I wrote for Girls on the Run about why I decided to become a
  coach. This is my second season coaching my daughter's team and to say this
  program is transformative is almost an understatement-- and not just for the
  girls, but for me as well. This program is near and dear to my heart, and I
  will continue to support it long after my girls are too old to participate.

When I was in second grade, a fellow classmate and friend took it upon her to ‘teach me how to run.’ Looking back, this friend of mine was the youngest of eight kids and had older sisters who were track stars in our community, qualifying for state year after year. At that age, I’m sure she was ‘playing coach’ to anyone who would listen, but the message I received is that I didn’t know how to run and needed to be taught. 

Fast forward to fourth grade, when someone told me I ran like a duck. I was usually one of the last kids standing anytime we had to pick teams, and the message I received was, “You’re not good enough to be on my team.”

Fast forward to fifth grade where we had to run the 600, and the two fastest girls in our class collapsed on the ground moaning and groaning afterwards because they had overexerted themselves. The message? “Running is hard and scary, and sometimes people pass out.”

Fast forward to seventh grade, and by then I had just given up. The 600 day in gym class preceded our scheduled school picture time, so I decided to boycott to preserve my hair (when in actuality, a little wind probably would have made it better!). I distinctly remember my gym teachers shaking their heads at me and saying, “We’re not asking you to sprint; we’re asking you to try.” It didn’t sink in. 

I had labeled myself not-good-at-sports, especially running, and because I believed it, everyone else did, too.

Where I did find solace and ease in my body was swimming. I joked that I was more comfortable in water than on land. While I never made it to state or was the fastest on my team, I loved the sport and worked hard. I played softball in high school and ran when I had to, but a slow jog always felt sustainable and sprinting hurt, so I never really tried to go fast or to run for too long. 

And then in college, I discovered running. Another non-runner friend and I decided to go out for 9 p.m. runs a few times a week. We’d pace ourselves by chatting through the whole two plus miles. We even signed up for a 5K December of our freshman year. Those runs became our saving grace-- a chance to vent to each other about school, friends, boys and whatever other topics came up and we became close. Feeling the emotional and physical relief after a run was similar to the way I felt after a long pool workout, but with the added benefit of talking to a friend instead of ruminating in my head. 

What I remember about that first 5K as a freshman in college was that it was hard; I don’t think I even finished under an hour, and walked most, if not all of mile 3. I wore that race shirt for years after though, and my friend and I framed our race bibs together as mementos. I had done something I thought I could not do. 

After that, my relationship with running was off and on until I moved to Milwaukee as a twenty something. My best friend from high school ran a marathon and I dutifully cheered her on, while telling myself I’d never ever do that because my body couldn’t handle it. 

And then, triathlon came into my life. I signed up for a relay triathlon with my best friend and another friend, where I swam, one biked, and the other ran. As soon as I came out of the water on race day, I yelled, “I want to keep going!” The next summer, I signed up for my first sprint triathlon and I cried my way across the finish line. Swim a ½ mile, bike 12 miles, and then run 3.1 miles after? I never thought my body would be capable of that. 

Fast forward to 25 triathlons later, countless 5k’s and a handful of 10k’s, and at age 41 I’m training for my first ½ marathon. I’ve qualified for the USA Triathlon Age-Group Nationals three times,  and have had age group podium finishes in sprint triathlons and the 5k. I’ve watched my 5k time drop from that hour + at age 18 to 25:12 at age 40. I continue to surprise myself at how much ease, relaxation and power I feel in my long runs, as in the past, running long distances felt as though it was just something I could not do. 



These days I don’t know what I’d do without running. I run alone, with my husband, with good friends, and these days with my daughter and our GOTR team. Running brings me peace, it brings me joy, it brings me strength; it allows me to get outside and be grateful for whatever weather the day brings. It helps me find beauty in the small things. 



When I look at my GOTR girls, the first thing I tell them is to race their own race at their own pace. This is my mantra, and hopefully it has become theirs. They don’t need to run fast, they don’t need to run hard (unless of course they want to, and some really do!), they don’t need to run alone. It doesn’t matter what they look like, how fast they go, as long as they keep moving forward. 



When I was their age, all I would have needed was for one person to say, “You have it in you. It doesn’t need to be scary, and you don’t need to go fast. You can just go, at your own pace at your own speed.” And that is why I say that out loud, some version of that message, at every practice. I’ve heard so many women say it: If only Girls on the Run had been around when I was that age. 



I want my GOTR girls to believe they can do hard things. 

I want them to believe that who they are today does not define who they become tomorrow. 

I want them to believe that the story they tell themselves can be changed.
