  Here's my race recap from our most recent 5k-- a $5 5K in Gabriel Park,
  Portland, OR. Read on and learn more about our latest destination race!

It is hard to believe that a week ago we were still running and relaxing in Portland, OR, on a family trip to visit Steve’s sister. I was still able to get plenty of training in, even though it was a scheduled rest/recovery week. 



Before our trip we looked into 5K’s in Portland, just because we’ve had great experiences in the past jumping into local road races visiting other towns. (Side note: One of our absolute favorites was the Alden Run in Alden, Michigan, a few years ago at the end of July). We didn’t find much in Portland for the weekend we were there, except for the $5 5k series. 



To be honest, we didn’t really know what to expect from this $5 5k-- a Portlandia version of a 5k  (rainbow tutus, bearded folk running barefoot) or a Nike sponsored run led by Shalane Flanagan, but were pleasantly surprised to find out that this 5k series was sponsored by Portland Park and Rec. The series runs June through August and alternates between five different city parks. Their goal was to get families out and moving and to experience Portland’s city parks. They promised food trucks, a DJ, and face painting and a 1K race for kids, a competitive 5k race starting at 9:00, and a family friendly wave starting at 9:30. When we showed up at Gabriel Park around 8:30 a.m., there was a small crowd gathering at the sign-up tents. We handed them $10 in cash and told them we would shoot for the competitive wave (for sub 25min 5K’ers). 



We looked at the course map and noted that there would be three loops in the park, which is in a family neighborhood and includes tennis courts, basketball courts (upgraded by Nike), a skate park, wooded trails, and lots of hills. Yes, hills! So Steve and I decided to run the course to warm up and were confused when we clocked 1.42 miles. Two loops at 2.84? Three loops? Not only that, but it was so hilly/grassy/gravelly that I knew there was no way I could hit a sub 25 (my PR is 25:17). So, in typical fashion, I started to freak out. Is it really three loops? Can I run in the competitive race if I can’t hit a sub 25? Do we have to stand around in the heat until 9:30 a.m. (did I mention it was over 80 degrees by 8:30 am?) We are supposed to go to the wineries this afternoon!? After a few moments of freak out, we pulled the race director (the lady with the mega phone) and asked her the tough questions: yes, I can run the competitive heat even if I can’t hit the pace; and no, it’s not three loops-- only two. 



Big sighs of relief, and then it was time to make our way to the start. The course director actually had us start .2 miles back from the finish, making it closer to an actual 5k (even though my official distance was still closer to 2.9). He talked us through the course, and mentioned that we had all showed up for the most challenging course of the entire series! The countdown began and we all started. 



I knew that I would be at the back of the pack since the race was technically for sub 25minute 5K’ers, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that I was not going to be in last place. I started out strong running down hill and eased into a comfortable pace. I started running with a girl and we probably ran together for the first .5 to full mile, but then I passed her when she stopped at the second water station. I gained on a younger couple and decided to hang on behind them as we climbed trails and ran through a grassy area. The girl was clearly struggling, and the guy with her was encouraging her, so I took the opportunity to pass them as we finished the first loop running across the baseball diamond. I started the second loop strong, finding a woman running alone in front of me. I set my sights on passing her, and slowly caught up to her at the first water station. After I passed her, there was literally no one else in front of me. This frustrated me slightly, as I always like someone to chase. I decided to settle in and keep plugging away with the goal of not letting anyone pass me. 



As I passed the second water station and ran into the woods, I could hear someone tailing me and sure enough, a guy ran right by me. I said something like, “Nice push-- we don’t have hills like this in Wisconsin!” and he responded, “Thanks! And I bet you don’t have this heat either.” I started to say, “Well, actually…” but then decided to save my breath for the final push of the race. I ended fairly strong, sprinting towards the finish. It was a doozy with the hills and the heat, and definitely no PR, or even close. My final time was 27:00 minutes/2.9miles/9:19mm. The elevation gain was 358 feet. 



The family-friendly atmosphere was great, and I kept thinking that Steve and I should do the Beer Garden 5K series here at local parks in our area. It looks like we missed out on a lot of fun races in this summer series, and I will definitely keep this in mind for next summer.
