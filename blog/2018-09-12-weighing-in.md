  Perhaps my most vulnerable post yet. The one that wanted to be written, but is
  hard to share. How I fell down the disordered eating hole, and what I'm doing
  to climb back out of it.

I was a little nervous yesterday as I sat waiting for my doctor in the patient room. I had lab work done a few weeks ago, and I was anxious for the results. I usually look them up online so I have a general idea, but I had misplaced the login and password and honestly didn’t have time in the last week to hunt for where I had written them down. As I sat waiting for her, I thought in my head all the excuses I would tell her to justify my poor lab results-- that I had been less careful about my eating, that I had been training pretty hard and teaching up to ten yoga classes a week, that I had indulged a little too much in gluten and dairy the week after my race, that I had gained a few pounds. 



But when she finally came in the room and asked me how I felt, I was surprised to hear her say, “Well, your labs look great. Your hormones are balanced, and all your numbers are all in the normal range for the first time in years.”



Wait, what? 



For as long as I can remember, almost as long as I’ve been seeing my doctor, my thyroid has been lagging, I’ve been suffering from adrenal fatigue, and more recently, my estrogen and progesterone have been out of whack. I take supplements, I exercise regularly while still listening to my body, I practice yoga and mindfulness, and I eat clean. It would frustrate me to no end to hear that I was still suffering from this lagging thyroid and adrenal fatigue after “doing all the right things.”



When I would see her in the office, she would tell me not so gently, “Only you can tell me why you have adrenal fatigue.”



The truth was hidden behind my own and our culture’s ideas about what it means to be healthy. And for me, it didn’t start when I was in high school or hitting puberty, but later in life. It started after the birth of my second daughter, when I was trying to shed my baby weight. 



When my youngest was six months old, I decided to follow a weight loss program with a good friend who lived in another state. We only saw each other once a year, and we checked in weekly to see how we were doing. We would text each other our weights every Monday, tips for what worked well, our struggles and triumphs of the journey. Normally, we don’t really keep in touch much and save all our big conversations for when we see each other each summer, but this was a fun way to stay connected all year. When we finally saw each other in person a year later, we were beyond excited about our transformations. I had lost over 20 lbs and she lost close to 30. We looked and felt fabulous. There was a number on the scale that I hadn’t seen in years. 



For years later, I still ‘weighed in’ every Monday, keeping track of my weight in an app or in my planner, and would notice subtle things like how my mood would fluctuate based on the number on the scale, or how I would convince myself that I needed to be better about snacking in the afternoons or withholding any kind of snack after an evening meal. If I was hungry between meals, I would look at my watch and tell myself to wait until a certain time before I allowed myself to eat. I knew these were warning signs of disordered eating patterns, but I continued them for years because I was happy when the scale tipped under a certain number.



And then slowly this summer, things began to change. When I signed up to work with my coach, she gave me tough workouts. I was paying for her advice and guidance, so I knew I had to fuel myself the best I could to be in great condition to execute her training plan. I was teaching yoga constantly, and I needed to eat before and after classes to be in peak condition to teach. No longer was it an option to just wait until class or a workout was over before I grabbed a snack. I started fueling myself before and after workouts, and ate whenever I started feeling hungry. I didn’t deny myself food when I was hungry.



I also became more relaxed about what I put into my body. I ate well 80% of the time, but I relaxed my rules for that other 20%. I ate ice cream and cheese curds and cheeseburgers, drank beer and rose and margaritas. When I was on vacation, I let myself be on vacation. 



These were all things I knew in my head and were common sense for me, but when I’m honest about my relationship with my diet and my body, I was not acting with love to my own self before. I was denying myself, ignoring signs of hunger, for a number on the scale. I wouldn’t do that to my husband, my children, or to a friend-- why was I doing this to myself? As I write this, it feels so cliche I wonder how I fell into the trap. In front of my daughters, I talk about eating as nourishment and fuel, and then I would turn around and look into my own bedroom mirror and criticize my body in my head. My actions spoke louder than my words and my body was listening. It was sending me messages through my thyroid and my adrenal glands.



I avoided weighing myself all summer, but I knew the number was creeping up based on the fit of my clothes. However, I didn’t care so much because I was becoming so damn fast! My legs were strong, I was gaining muscle, and I was elated with my performance on the track and on my bike. I was PR’ing right and left! My body was telling me that whatever I was doing was right, and yet I still felt I was still doing something wrong because my shorts were getting tight. 



When my doctor on Monday asked what I was doing differently, I told her honestly, “I’m trying to not worry so much about my weight, and I’ve put on a few pounds.” We talked about how hard that is for our culture, how hard it is for me to not be so concerned with the number on the scale, and how, at 41 years old, I’m still grappling with this. She reminded me that I was not alone. 



What I know is that I feel the best I’ve felt in years, but I have work to do to accept how my body has changed. It starts with me being aware of and identifying the negative self-talk when it happens. All I can really say is that it’s a work in progress, but I know that my body is happy that I’m taking the time to finally figure it out. My lab results proved it.
