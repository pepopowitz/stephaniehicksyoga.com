  As I start training for my first half-marathon, is it crazy to set a goal?
  From the yogic perspective, yes and no. Read on to find out why.

I have done something I thought I’d never do. I know that sounds pretty dramatic, but there really was a time in my life where I never thought I’d ever sign up for a half-marathon. But in the past six months, maybe even a year, I’ve been rolling the idea around in my head, bouncing it off my husband and friends. Earlier in the spring, Steve signed up for his first half-marathon, and that solidified it in my mind. We have been toying with the idea of signing up for a ½ IronMan in the future, so a half marathon is the next logical step. Then I ran my first 8 mile run in Eagle River as part of my triathlon training, and it became real. If I can run eight miles comfortably, what’s another five? 

Based on conversations with people and social media posts, there is a thing about hitting a sub 2 hour ½ marathon. There are training plans devoted to it. There is a list of hashtags relating to it. So naturally, without even looking at a training plan, before even signing up for the race,  before even figuring out what the minute per mile pace would be, that has been my goal. 

When I told my husband this, he laughed at me. “Why would you set a goal for a distance you’ve never done?”  When people ask me for triathlon advice for their first race, I usually tell them, “Just have fun for the first one, and then set goals for the next race based on how it went.” 

Well, I’m reluctant to take my advice this time. Why? When I’m honest about it, part of it comes down to ego. 

I’ve been training and building endurance all summer. I’m still in good shape after running all summer. 

How fun would it be to achieve a big goal for my first race?

I can use a hashtag! (If you follow me on Instagram, you might notice that I almost never use hashtags). 

People expect that I can already do this. 

The hard part of this now as I enter into my first week of training is unattaching myself to this goal. As part of my yoga teacher training program, we studied the Yamas and the Niyamas, the guidelines of how to live a yogic life. (Think of it as the Ten Commandments of yoga). One of my favorite yamas to study was Aparigraha-- non-possessiveness-- especially in relation to our own identities and even to goals. How attached am I to my identity as a triathlete and yogi, and even to my identity as a mom and wife? Who am I if those things are taken away? How much do we depend on our own identities to define us? How much emotional attachment do I place in setting goals and accomplishing them in different areas of my life? 

What it comes down to is this: At our core, we are all capable and deserving of love with or without our identities, accomplishments, and goals. Those identities and goals drive us to be better people which in turn, benefits our world, so it’s not necessarily bad. We should not stop training for races, setting scary goals, and working our butts off to achieve them. But depending on them too much, putting all our weight on the outcome can lead to unhappiness if the identity is taken away, or if the goal is not reached. 

I’ve had races where the attachment to the outcome resulted in sadness, disappointment and frustration. Learning how to manage that is tricky, and over the years, I’m still working on it. 

How? 

Number one, enjoying the journey and not the outcome. Enjoying the sunlight shining on my face as I head east on an early morning run. Finding the quiet pockets of forest and trees on my bike rides on suburban trails. Getting into that meditative space, counting laps and connecting with my breath while swimming outside at Hoyt Pool. Each one of these activities brings me small moments of joy while grinding out even the hardest workouts. 

Number two, using the race as a celebration of my hard work of training. Executing a training plan to my best ability, and then coming into the race enjoying the social aspect of it and using it as a chance to showcase the hard work I've put into it. Race day = party time! 

And finally, giving up the control. Who knows what can happen on race day? A thunderstorm, a bad meal the night before, dropping a wine bottle and breaking your toe. Stuff happens, no matter how hard you work. 

So what does that mean as I head into my first week of training? At the end of the day, I will still train to hit that sub 2 hour race. I’ll keep working on that goal. But I’ll keep my ego in check, and know that if I don’t hit that goal this time, life will go on just as it has before. And I’ll happily keep hitting pavement, finding those joyful moments, for as long as my body allows.
