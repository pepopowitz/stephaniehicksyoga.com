  Choosing a bike ride over folding laundry feels good in the moment, but it
  also comes with a twinge of guilt and sometimes regret. There are never enough
  hours in the day to accomplish all that needs to get done, so when is the
  right time to take a step back and ask for help?

Currently, as I’m writing this, I have 2,428 emails in my inbox, laundry in the dryer, dishes in the sink, assignments to grade, and about 24 minutes before I pick my girls up from school. I’m texting back and forth about planning for Girl Scouts and our school’s Fun Run, and I’m just a little bit overwhelmed. The age old saying, “I’ll rest when I’m dead,” makes more sense to me day by day. 



My house is a mess most of the time, and I’m barely staying on top of the laundry, but I’m being pulled to get outside and workout everyday. That pull wins more often than not, even though a cleaner house would definitely create a calmer and more peaceful home environment. Last week, when the weather was 80 degrees and sunny, I finished my work for the day early enough to fit a 25 mile bike ride in. As I rode past my neighbor’s house, I stopped to chat. “I’m vacuuming,” she said. “I should be vacuuming!” I replied and told her about the dust bunnies I saw on my basement steps as I brought my bike outside. We both joked about how our houses are never clean enough, but sometimes you just have to say screw it, especially when the weather is 80 in September.



These days are fleeting. Someday, in the next couple of months, I’ll look back to the days this summer and how good it felt to have the sun beating on my back as I rode my bike on a quiet trail. I’ll look back to those cool early morning runs, the swims in the outdoor pools, the days spent in flip flops and tank tops. In the next 50 years, (as I would love to still be running in 40!) I hope to look back and be happy that I chose the sunshine over the Swiffer, my running shoes over running the vacuum cleaner, and a bike ride over getting rid of dust bunnies. 



Lately, the thought of hiring a cleaning service comes up more often in conversation. While we’re still holding out, I feel like paying for someone to do the things we don’t like to do makes more sense than not. My husband and I are investing more time following our dreams trying to set the example for our girls to do the same. Doesn’t it make sense to ask for help? We can’t do it all, and it’s important to face that truth with honesty. 



We are still figuring it all out, but my priorities have always been my health, my marriage and kids, and a clean and happy home. But lately, it’s more like my health, marriage and kids, triathlon/half-marathon training, and teaching yoga. A sparkly home has definitely been put on the back burner, but I know it’s still important. It’s also important to be the example of work before play, and I know we break that a lot when we go to the beach instead of mowing the lawn (sorry neighbors), or watch a family movie instead of doing dishes. We are building family memories, but I worry sometimes that we’re not setting a good example. 



One of the yamas of yoga is saucha and it translates to cleanliness. Not just a cleanliness of your environment, but also of your spirit. It’s not only a “leave the place cleaner than you found it,” but living your life with a clean spirit, a decluttering of your soul per se. One of the ways I “clean” my spirit is through training and practicing yoga, racing, teaching yoga, and coaching Girls on the Run, leading Girl Scouts. Those activities bring me back to myself, foster connection with others, challenge me, and make me happy. Yes, all those things take a lot of time, but they bring me calm, help me feel peace. A clean house definitely does, too; now, I just need to find a couple more hours a day to do it. Or take the leap and ask for help.
