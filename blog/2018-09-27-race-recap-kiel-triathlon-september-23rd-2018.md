summary: >-
  I tried to make this short, but just couldn't swing it. I even took out
  (almost) all the tiny details about pretty much everything I ate in the 24
  hours before my race, because as Steve said, "Nobody really cares about that."
  So here you go, folks-- all the details about my last race of the season,
  which ended with a step up on the podium!

Woo hoo!!! Last race of the season! Don’t get me wrong, I love all things triathlon, but after my goal races in August, I start losing a little bit of steam. Typically, I take a week off after a goal race, and then momentum kind of slips. I start easing back into training again, but my motivation wanes and I’m more likely to skip a few workouts. Kids are in school, I start getting more students of my own again, and I start coaching Girls on the Run. Nights become busy, and I have a harder time fitting workouts in. Then, at some point, I start making peace with the fact that my fitness is declining and this will be a ‘fun’ race, not a super competitive one. This is what happened last year, and sure enough, it happened again. 

It is a good thing then, that this race is so darn fun! It is in my hometown and a fundraiser for the ailing football fields, track and auditorium. My dad’s class of 1971 was the first class to graduate from the “new high school” and my dad ran track on the same surface that is the track now, some 47 years later (but who’s counting, right Dad?!). The tri was the brilliant idea of an alumni who loves all things triathlon and recently qualified for IronMan Kona-- woot woot, Amy Fuhrman!!

Lila and I did it last year in its first inaugural run, and we both had second place finishes in our age group-- my first podium finish ever. We were both excited to sign up for it again. 

The week before the race was a little crazy. Olivia was diagnosed with a double ear infection, and then Lila started getting a cold. My week was a little overwhelming, and sure enough by Thursday night, I also started feeling like I was getting sick. I started worrying a little bit. After doing 25 triathlons, I’ve never done one sick. I’ve had allergies, but that’s pretty much it. Friday night I rested all evening, going to bed super early, and then woke up Saturday morning feeling meh. I also had to teach a yoga class Saturday morning and felt a little sluggish afterwards, so after Lila’s soccer game, we all ventured out to the Soup Market and ate chicken noodle soup for lunch, crossing my fingers that this would be the magical elixir. 

I came home and napped for a bit (which I hardly ever do!), and then started packing my bag for the race the next day. As I began to move through the list of what I needed, I realized that I couldn’t find my goggles. I have extra pairs, but none of them fit quite as good as the ones I couldn’t find. I threw a pair of giant (to me) goggles in my bag, and tried to roll with it. Hmmm, a cold, missing goggles-- was this a sign of what was to come?!

I got packed up, and as I finished, I checked the mail and realized that my subscription box of Picky Oats had arrived. My fuel of choice for race mornings had come earlier than expected. I still couldn’t find my goggles (even calling the last place I swam to see if they were there, to no avail), but at least I had my Picky Oats!

We got the girls packed up and ready to go and we started heading up to Kiel (about 1 hour and 15 minutes north), hoping to make packet pickup at 5:00 p.m. when it closed. After about ½ hour in the car, Lila asked, “Dad, did you grab my triathlon bag?” to which Steve replied, “No, did you grab your triathlon bag?” That was when I suddenly had an ‘aha’ moment and blurted out, “My goggles are in my swim bag!!!” (My bag where I keep my kickboard, pull buoy, and flippers). 

So we turned around, headed back to Tosa, and grabbed everything we needed. I still had a sore throat, but my goggles were found, Lila had what she needed to race, and all was almost all right with the world. We headed back up to Kiel, and I was almost relieved that we had to turn around. I would have swam with my other goggles, but it sure was nice to have my favorites. 

We spent the night at my parents, and I went to bed super early. I set my alarm for 6 a.m. and woke up around 5:50. I was feeling better than the day before, but still felt lethargic. I finished getting ready, headed out around 6:45 a.m. and made it to packet pickup pretty early. I saw some familiar faces and got bodymarked, and then grabbed my bike from the car as Steve went back to my parents’ house. I saw an old friend from high school and my sister-in-law and chatted with them as we headed to transition. I set up my transition, and then helped my sister-in-law set up hers. The weather was chilly, in the low fifties early, but I could feel it was going to warm up. On my phone, the weather app I use reported a one mph wind coming from the east, which was basically perfect conditions for the race! 

It is always a little crazy sitting in the pool area waiting for the race to start. They made a few remodeling updates to the area since 1995, but the brown and yellow tiles remain the same. The records are still up on the wall, and there are a few remaining from my swim team years (only the boys’ teams, not the girls’). I think back to who I was then, how much has changed, and it just feels a little surreal. Would I ever have envisioned my life as it is now? Could I ever have imagined it would be this good? I let my mind wander about that the last few moments getting ready for the race, and those thoughts fueled my fire to prove to my 16 year-old self what is possible. 

Eventually, I took a gu and was lining up in order of our 150 yard split. I was the twelfth person to go, second woman in the water, and from the moment I started swimming, I felt like it was going to be tough. It was only 150 yards, but it did not feel smooth and instead felt like a struggle. It was over so quickly, and by the time I got out of the pool and ran to transition, I realized that even though I felt sluggish, I was still only a second slower than last year. Looking back, parts of me remembered swimming the 500 in the same pool years and years ago, but I didn’t really connect with the moment. In just two minutes and some odd seconds, it was over, and I was running outside the pool doors towards my bike. 

I started putting on my long sleeve, but it didn’t actually feel that cold, so I ended up taking it back off. I rushed through transition, jumped on my bike and started heading down the hill past my old high school. The bike course actually changed this year, which was a good switch, but it added .6 tenths of a mile to the ride. I felt fast on the first few miles, passing people and keeping up with a pack of guys. Eventually, it started to fade and I fell behind, but maintained a good pace that I was comfortable with. I wondered how long I was going to be able to keep it up, and 15 miles felt long. The one mile winds coming from the east felt like a lie-- the wind picked up and felt like it was coming from the west. The back half of the course is one hill after another, but eventually I felt as though I was getting in a rhythm and before I knew it, I was halfway through. 

Soon after, I caught up with my sister-in-law heading up a hill and cheered for her as I passed her. I continued on, winding through a bike path, and then heading back towards my high school. Looking at my time, I knew that I didn’t hit my goal time, but at that point didn’t realize that the new course was so much longer. Looking at the results afterwards, I realized that I was faster this year, improving from a 16 mph ride last year to a 16.5 mph hour ride this year. Had it been the same course as last year, I definitely would have shaved a few minutes off my time. 

Transition 2 was fast and I headed out on the run. I started out strong with a 8:45 mm pace, but then settled into a pace closer to 9:00+ mm holding off until my heart rate slowed. As I continued running, I started picking up the pace and feeling really comfortable. During my ride, I let myself worry about what the run would bring because I felt fatigued earlier than I hoped, but on the run I felt like I was able to settle into a smooth and easy stride. Mile one was 9:02. As I rounded the turnaround at Mile 1.35, one of the volunteers yelled, “You’re the first female! You’re in the lead!” I yelled back, “Woo hoo!! I’ll take it!”

As I turned and started heading back towards the school, I could see a few women gaining on me. Knowing that I had less than two miles to go, but the majority of it on the cross country trails, I knew I had to keep pushing. One woman especially seemed to be gaining on me pretty fast, so I kept her in my mind focusing on staying ahead of her. I knew I had a target on my back being the first female. Compared to last year, the last few miles of the race felt stronger. I remember wanting to stop about a ½ mile out from the finish last year, and this year I felt like I could hold my pace.. Miles 2 and 3 were 8:39 and 9:06 respectively, and I sprinted to the finish with a 27:41 finish compared to last years 29:26. 

I was exhausted, but happy. Despite my sluggishness, I felt like I really picked it up and maintained a good lead. I knew that compared to last year, I had a faster run, but a slower bike due to the course change but was still pleased with the results on my Garmin. Right away, Lila was getting ready for her own race, so I headed to the pool after talking to a few people. Once Lila was on the bike, my sister-in-law approached me and asked if I had seen my results. I said no, and she asked, “Well, do you want the good news or the bad news?” In my head there was no bad news-- I had fun, so what could be bad? She told me that I was first in my age group, but didn’t reach my goal time of shaving minutes off last year’s time. I didn’t take the time to explain that the course was longer, so even though I was faster on the bike and the run than last year, it wouldn’t be reflected in my time because it was shorter last year. The thing about triathlons is that they are so hard to compare to each other-- a different course means adjusting your goals and your mindset about those goals, sometimes even midrace. I had given up the idea of beating last year’s time towards the end of the bike and made peace with that. I was still going to push and leave it all on the course.

The first place win didn’t really hit me right away. It was when awards started, and I was sitting in the bleachers watching people climb on the podiums, that it really started sinking in. When they called my name and I stepped on that podium, it was so fun! Definitely not something I would have envisioned for myself all those years ago sitting on those same bleachers playing my flute in the school pep band for football games or as I swam laps after school. It felt like a full circle moment.

Looking back, several days out, this race really was the perfect way to end the season. My first time standing on a first place podium on the track of my old high school-- if you would have told my high school self I would have ended up here over 20 years later I never would have believed it.
