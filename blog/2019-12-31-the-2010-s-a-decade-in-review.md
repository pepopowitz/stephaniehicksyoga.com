  My only blog post from 2019 is a decade in review. While I'm bummed I didn't
  write more and share more of my year, I'm excited to post this and spend more
  of 2020 writing and reflecting. I will also be doing a bit of a refresh of my
  website and blog in general, so stay tuned!

When I first looked at these two pictures, it was hard for me to come up with words. So I just started making a list, and this is what I came up with-- a list of ten reflections, lessons, observations between triathlon #5 in July 2009 and aquathlon #3 this past November:

1. I’m proud of myself for making my passion a priority in my life for the last decade. It takes hard work to do that, including the difficult work of putting my needs and my health first.

2. The woman on the left really did not think herself capable of being the woman on the right. I wondered what the secret was of those who finished first, who made it to the podium. It was out of my realm. 

3. But, at the same time, the woman on the left in 2009 didn’t really aspire to that. I did it for fun; I did it to work towards a goal; I did it because crossing the finish line was so darn fun and rewarding. Sometimes, it still makes me cry. 

4. It was only years later, when I was struggling with the mundane and turning 37, that I decided to focus on what I was passionate about, and for a season decided to commit to triathlon training. In that year, I set a goal of trying to execute every workout in the training plan to the best of my ability. While the race itself was a little lackluster (I remember being really disappointed in my performance that day-- and funny, now I don’t remember why), I ended up qualifying for 2015 Age Group Nationals. I still remember getting that email and asking Steve, “Is this a joke?”

5. What I love about these photos is the JOY: the joy of being a mom, and for finishing a triathlon for the first time as a mom-- it felt like a different kind of feat. Not only that, but I shaved a ton of time off my PR that race proving to myself that moms can be way stronger post-baby than they were pre-baby. 

6. The JOY in the second photo was from qualifying for Aquathlon Worlds despite being injured. I had to not only really learn to listen to my body and honor what it was telling me, but I had to practice patience and not getting back into running too quickly. I actually only ran two very short practice runs in the weeks leading up to this race, and both runs told me I had to ease off and rest. 

7. Triathlon/Aquathlon/Running with friends is the best. I did the race on the left with a good friend, and my memories from that race are laughing and talking a little too late in the night before squishing together in a queen-sized bed at her parents’ house near the race. At Aquathlon Worlds in Miami, our team travelled together, and one of the highlights was racing and hanging out with friends before and after the race, congratulating and cheering each other on. I would not be the athlete I am today without my friends and teammates pulling me out of bed for workouts before the sun rises. 

8. Not only that, but Steve was by my side at each of these races, being the best sherpa ever-- carrying my shoes, getting my bike ready, talking me off the ledge, and providing hugs. In 2009, he had no intention of ever getting into triathlon, and since then, has not only done a bunch of them alongside me (and crushed me every single time!), but he has also found a passion for trail running (I’m still refining my sherpa skills--they are in very early developmental stages). He is a supportive partner, and I’m so grateful to share life with someone who is also equally as dedicated to following his passion. 

9. When I look at the photo on the left, it makes me think about how new I was to being a mom. I was just starting to realize that the actions that I model in my own day-to-day have a lasting impact on my daughter (now daughters). I do triathlon for myself, but I know my actions do not go unnoticed by my girls-- they watch me train, set goals, achieve them (and sometimes not achieve them). They know that hard work sometimes translates to success and sometimes doesn’t on race day. They know that it’s important to do hard and scary things. They know the importance of listening to their bodies, fueling it for not only performance, but for overall health. 

10. Triathlon has made me laugh and cry. It is broken me down, but also has built me up. I don’t know where I would be without it. It has made me resilient and tough, but also humble and gentle. It has been a crazy ride, and I’m excited to see what the next decade brings. Going into 2020, my intentions are to continue to listen to my body, train smart, stay mentally tough, and to relish in the feelings of JOY, whether they happen race day, or watching the sun rise on the way to an early morning swim, or a laugh on a long run with my husband. I’ll follow the JOY where it leads me; and I know I can’t go wrong.
